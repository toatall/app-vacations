# Ping CRM on Yii 2

A Yii 2 demo application to illustrate how [Inertia.js](https://inertiajs.com) works.

With Inertia you are able to build single-page apps using classic server-side routing and controllers, without building an API.

This application is a port of the original [Ping CRM written in Laravel](https://github.com/inertiajs/pingcrm) and based on the [Yii 2 Basic Project Template](https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2-app-basic).

**Based on the application https://github.com/tbreuss/pingcrm-yii2**

Changes: Updated Vue to version 3, updated npm packages and composer. Converted Vue files to Composition API (script setup).

## Extending this project

The following steps are required when extending this project with new features.

### In the backend

- add new controller, that extends from inertia controller
- add one ore more actions
- return from the actions with a call to the inertia render method   

~~~php
<?php

namespace app\controllers;

use tebe\inertia\web\Controller;

class CustomController extends Controller
{
    public function actionIndex()
    {
        $params = [
            'data' => [],
        ];
        return $this->inertia('demo/index', $params);
    }
}
~~~

You can find more information at <https://github.com/tbreuss/yii2-inertia>.

### In the frontend

- add a new page under `resources/js/Pages` for each controller action you added in the backend 
- copy&paste one of the existing page examples
- implement and/or extend Vue.js stuff as needed
- use frontend tooling as described here and in package.json
